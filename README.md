# odin_recipes

The Odin Project basic recipe website

Self Reflection on this simple project

This website will help me learn and consolidate HTML and CSS concepts I've learnt through Odin's Project
In this project I expect to use simple tags suchs as: html, head, body, p, h1, ul/ol as well as text modifing tags: strong, bold, em, i, headings

It will also help me consolidate and practice Git as well as to improve Git commit messages and to maintain a better Log of commits
